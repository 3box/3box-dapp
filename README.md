# Components
## Social Profile
The primary feature of the 3Box Profiles App is that it allows Ethereum users to create a social profile for their Ethereum account. 3Box profiles consist of various public and encrypted information saved by the user and other applications (with the user's consent). 

### Public Profiles
Public profiles include information such as name, image, description, and emoji. They also include Twitter and Github account verifications. Applications can save additional information to the user's public profile, such as public group affiliations and more. Public profiles are available for all to query using the getProfile() method in the 3Box.js API, even without the user's consent â€“ since the information is public.

### Private Profile
Private profiles include information such as email and birthday.

## Activity Feed
Activity feeds display a unified view on a user's activity from across various Ethereum networks, as well as within 3Box.
